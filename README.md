# Rory Dick (https://mpil.life)

Aerospace engineer and researcher focused on modelling/simulation of dynamic systems, and on AI safety / existential risk mitigation.

Founder, **Mission to Protect Intelligent Life (MPIL)** — https://mpil.life

## Focus

- **Space systems (GNC, launch operations):** high‑fidelity dynamics, control, and verification under uncertainty
- **Simulation & optimisation:** Python-first toolbuilding; trajectory / systems modelling; reproducible analysis
- **AI safety & x-risk:** evaluation, auditing, and practical research toward safer frontier systems

## Highlighted public projects

- **Off‑grid space comms (prototype + notes):** https://github.com/rorydick/off-grid-space-comms
- **AI misalignment bounty (eval harness):** https://github.com/rorydick/ai-misalignment-bounty
