### Hi, I'm Rory.

I am an **Aerospace Engineer** and **Researcher** specialising in the modelling, simulation, and control of complex dynamic systems.

My background is in **Space Systems Engineering**, where I trained to design and verify complex engineering systems. Currently, I apply this systems-thinking mindset to **Existential Risk Mitigation** as the Founder of [Mission to Protect Intelligent Life (MPIL)](https://www.mpil.life).

### 🚀 Engineering & Dynamic Systems
My technical specialisation is **high-fidelity modelling of dynamic systems** for engineering applications. I build simulations from first principles to validate system performance under uncertainty.

*   **Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC):** Algorithm development for orbital launch vehicles and spacecraft.
*   **Mathematical Optimisation:** Applied convexification-based optimisation for retro-propulsive rocket landing trajectories.
*   **Simulation:** Developing modular, object-oriented simulation frameworks in **Python** and **MATLAB/Simulink**.
*   **Verification & Validation (V&V):** Analysing heterogeneous datasets to ensure systems meet strict safety requirements.

### 🛡️ Existential Risk Research
At **MPIL**, I run an open research platform conducting research to safeguard the future of life. We focus on neglected, high-stakes challenges:

*   **AI Safety:** Empirical audits of emergent capabilities and privacy risks in frontier models.
*   **Biosecurity:** Analysing dual-use risks and democratised access to biological design tools.
*   **Disaster Contingencies:** Strategic stability for humanity in the event of catastrophe.

### 📂 Featured Work

**🔭 Whole-Mission Launch Vehicle Simulation**
*   *Status: Private / Commercial Protection*
*   Developed a 5,000+ line Python framework to model the ascent, re-entry, and powered descent of a reusable rocket stage. Integrated aerodynamics, propulsion, and orbital mechanics to run multi-variable parametric analyses for design optimisation.

**🕵️ Emergent Identity Inference in LLMs**
*   *Status: Active Research*
*   Architected a zero-cost experimental framework ("The Public Data Ghost Audit") to quantify the ability of public LLMs to synthesise accurate profiles from anonymised data.

**🤖 AI Misalignment Bounty**
*   *Status: Public*
*   Designed an evaluation environment to test for specification gaming in autonomous agents for a Palisade Research competition.
